Asset Management Software – Feature List

1. Understanding the Client’s Requirement
From the discussion with the client, the main requirement is to build a simple system to manage company assets. The client wants an easy way to keep track of:
What assets the company owns
Which employee is currently using a particular asset
The goal of this system is to reduce confusion around asset ownership and make it quick and easy to identify who is responsible for any given item at a particular time.

2. Creative Decisions Taken
While designing this system, a few basic decisions were made to keep things simple and practical:
The application is planned as a basic web-based system
The project is given a straightforward name: Asset Management System
Only essential features are included in the first version
The focus is more on clarity and usability rather than advanced or complex functionality

3. Assumptions Made
To keep the system simple and manageable, the following assumptions are made:
Every asset will have a unique ID or name
Every employee will have a unique employee ID
An asset can be assigned to only one employee at a time
An employee can have multiple assets assigned to them
Only administrators will have permission to add or remove assets
Employee login functionality is not required in the initial version

4. Feature List
1. Add Asset
Allows the admin to add a new asset by entering basic details such as:
Asset name
Asset ID
2. Add Employee
Allows the admin to add employee details including:
Employee name
Employee ID
3. Assign Asset
This feature allows an asset to be assigned to a specific employee.
4. View Asset List
Displays a list of all assets along with their current status (assigned or unassigned).
5. View Assigned Assets
Shows which assets are currently assigned to which employees.
6. Update Asset Assignment
Allows updating asset ownership when:
An asset is returned
An asset is reassigned to another employee
5. Questions for the Next Client Meeting
To better understand future requirements and possible improvements, the following questions can be discussed with the client:
What types of assets need to be tracked (e.g., laptops, phones, accessories)?
Do employees need access to the system in the future?
Should returned assets be tracked separately or marked with a specific status?
Is it acceptable to store only minimal employee information?
Will this system be used only internally?
Do you want reporting or export features (like Excel or PDF) later on?
